Capstone: Analyzing (Social) Network Data by University of California, San Diego
- Week One Assignment

Converts social network data into a directed graph.
Extracts the following subgraphs from the whole graph:
- Egonet Graph: a part of a social network centered around 
  a selected node(person). Contains the central node, its neighbor nodes
  and all the edges (connections) among those nodes.
- Strongly Connected Components(SCCs) Graph: a set of nodes 
  where each node in the set can be reached by any other node from
  the same set through an edge/edges (directly through one edge
  or indirectly through several edges).
