Capstone: Analyzing (Social) Network Data by University of California, San Diego
- Week One Assignment: Class GraphLoader, Interface Graph and a pseudo code 
  for finding SCC Graphs are provided by UCSD MOOC team.
  The rest of the code is developed according to the vision of each individual student.

Converts social network data into a directed graph.
Extracts the following subgraphs from the whole graph:
- Egonet Graph: a part of a social network centered around 
  a selected node (person). Contains the central node, its neighbor nodes
  and all the edges (connections) among those nodes.
- Strongly Connected Components (SCC) Graph: a set of nodes 
  where each node in the set can be reached by any other node from
  the same set through an edge/edges (directly through one edge
  or indirectly through several edges).
